imageToggler
============

A jQuery Plugin to manage the toggling of staff images in the Maxwell Forest website

### First

Assuming you have `Node.js` installed.

```bash
npm install
```

## To Test

```bash
grunt test
```

Note that by default this will supress any console.log output.  To get that output as well you need to add the `--debug` flag, which also generates a lot of `phantomjs` noise.

### To Build

```bash
grunt
```

This will output the final distribution files into the `dist/` folder, prefixed with `jquery` and suffixed with the version number you specify in `package.json`.

Files created are:

* `jquery-imageToggler.1.0.0.js` - the 'developer' version.
* `jquery-imageToggler.1.0.0.min.js` The minified version for production use.
* `jquery-imageToggler.1.0.0.min.map` The `sourcemap` file for debugging using the minified version.
